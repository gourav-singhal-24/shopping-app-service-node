### Journals and Issues
A `Journal` represents a regularly published media such as a Magazine.
Each Journal may publish an `Issue` regularly, like most magazines have monthly, or yearly issues.

A `Journal` can have a title, a description, may be a website link, and a brand/logo image attachment.

An `Issue` is always related to a `Journal`. An issue always has a publication timestamp,
along with a simpler title. An issue can have one or more file attachments (like scanned PDF versions).

#### Creation and updates
Journals, and then their issues are created by Admin users. The creation also involves file attachments.
